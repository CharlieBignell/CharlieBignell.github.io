# Portfolio Website

A simple portfolio website to document a challenge I've set myself of completeing a different project each month from Sep 2021 - Sep 2021.

Includes 3 pages:
- **Home**: A homepage explaining a bit about me and the purpose of the website
- **About Me**: Not implemented yet. Will be an online-version of my CV.
- **Porjects**: Links to project pages, which explain the purpose and implementation of each project.
