            <h1>Project I: Web Development</h1>
            <h2>September 2021</h2>
            <p>In 2014, I decided I wanted to study computer science at University. Given that my school didn't offer it
                as an A-Level, I was worried I'd be behind everyone, so I taught myself HTML, CSS and JavaScript using
                online tutorials. Since then, I've used HTML and CSS throughout the last 7 years on various personal
                projects,
                university modules and on my placement year. So putting together
                a simple website like this wasn't much of a learning curve.</p>
            <p>There were two elements that were new to me, though:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Hosting</strong><br>Even though I've made plenty of web pages over the last few years, I've
                    never
                    owned a domain or put too much thought into the back-end infrastructure that goes into web
                    development. After a bit of research, I bought the domain <em>charliebignell.uk</em> and paid for
                    hosting via <a href="https://www.pilchard.co.uk/">Pilchard.co.uk</a>. I then developed the webiste
                    using <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>. I've used Pages a couple of times and
                    it's a really quick and easy way to get a website up and running quickly, and I was already
                    uploading the cde to GitHub so it seemed like the best choice. I then had
                    to tell GitHub Pages to use my cutom domain, which was more complicated than expected but I got
                    there in the end.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Developing for mobile</strong><br>test test</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Aside from that, it was as simple as creating a basic html structure, adding some fancy CSS, and writing
                the content. The writing was definitely the most difficult part.</p>
