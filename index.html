            <h1>Hello</h1>
            <p>I'm Charlie, a health intelligence analyst at Imperial College London. In 2020 I graduated from the
                University of Surrey with First Class Honours in Computer Science. </p>

            <p>In December of 2019, I was offered a graduate job at McLaren; which, as a huge Formula One fan, was a
                dream come true.
                Unfortunately this dream was over before it began, as the offer was recsinded in May 2020 due to the
                Coronavirus pandemic.
                Trying to find a job in Summer 2020 was not the easiest task, and after many stressful weeks of coding
                tests and online interviews, I secured a position as a health intelligence analyst at Imperial
                College London. As part of a two-year project funded by the Medical Research Council, I
                produce data visualisation tools for the neonatal research group stationed at Chelsea and
                Westminster Hospital in London.</p>

            <p>I've enjoyed my time here, but as it's only a two-year contract, I'll be moving on in September 2022.
                One thing I realised when applying for jobs back in 2020, was that almost every
                application process
                asked for my website or GitHub profile. I've dabbled with many different projects over my time at
                university, but none of
                them were complete enough (nor the code clean enough) for me to be comfortable being judged
                on them.
                So that's why I've challeneged myself to complete 12 projects over the next 12 months. </p>

            <p>This portfolio website is the first project, and it's where I'll document the next eleven. I've
                opted against simply
                cleaning up my half-finished projects scattered across various USB sticks and hard drives, as it gives
                me an opportunity
                to learn new skills and re-fresh old ones. I'm aiming for each of the 12 projects to focus on a
                different computer
                science discipline or set of skills. </p>

            <p>All the code for the projects will be available on my <a
                    href="https://github.com/CharlieBignell?tab=repositories">GitHub profile</a>, and I'll be briefly
                documenting each project <a href="./Projects.html">on this website.</a></p>

            <p>Enjoy!</p>
