            <h1>Hi, I'm Charlie</h1>
            <p>In 2020, I graduated from the
                University of Surrey with First Class Honours in Computer Science. In December of 2019, I was offered a
                graduate job at McLaren; which, as a huge Formula One fan, was a
                dream come true.
                Unfortunately this dream was over before it began, as the offer was recsinded in May 2020 due to the
                Coronavirus pandemic.</p>

            <p> Trying to find a job in Summer 2020 was not the easiest task, and after many stressful weeks of coding
                tests and online interviews, I secured a position as a health intelligence analyst at Imperial
                College London. As part of a two-year project funded by the Medical Research Council, I
                produce data visualisation tools for the neonatal research group at Chelsea and
                Westminster Hospital in London.</p>

            <p>I've enjoyed my time here, but as it's only a two-year contract, I'll be moving on in September 2022.
                One thing I realised when applying for jobs back in 2020 was that almost every
                application process
                asked for a website or GitHub profile. I've dabbled with many different projects over my time at
                university, but none of
                them were complete enough (nor the code clean enough) for me to feel comfortable making them public,
                especially when future employers could be on the recieving end.</p>

            <p>As I'm now (September 2021) preparing for my next role, I thought it'd be a good idea to put something
                together to showcase my skills, so that's why I've challenged myself to complete twelve projects over the
                next twelve months.

                This portfolio website is the first project, and it's where I'll document the next eleven. I could have just
                cleaned up my half-finished projects that are currently scattered across various USB sticks and hard drives, but this way will give
                me an opportunity
                to learn new skills and re-fresh old ones. I'm aiming for each of the twelve projects to focus on a
                different programming language or discipline. </p>

            <p>All of the code for the projects will be available on my <a
                    href="https://github.com/CharlieBignell?tab=repositories" target="_blank">GitHub profile</a>, and I'll be briefly
                documenting each project <a href="./projects">on the project pages.</a></p>

            <p>Enjoy!</p>
