            <h1>Hello</h1>
            <p>I'm Charlie, a health intelligence analyst at Imperial College London. In 2020 I graduated from the
                University of Surrey with First Class Honours in Computer Science. </p>
                
                <p>In December of 2019, I was offered my dream job working in the IT graduate scheme at McLaren. In May 2020, this offer was recsinded due to the
                Coronavirus Pandemic. What quickly followed was mass-job applications in a hope I could secure a job by September,
                so as to not leave me homeless. In July I secured a job as a health intelligence analyst at Imperial College London,
                working to produce data visualisation tools for the neonatal research group stationed at Chelsea and Westminster
                Hospital. </p>
                
                <p>It's been a great opportunity, but it is only a two-year contract, and so come September 2022, I will have 
                to move on. One thing I realised when applying for jobs last time around, was that almost every application process
                asked for my website or GitHub profile. I've dabbled with many different projects over my time at university, but none of 
                them were complete enough (nor the code clean enough to be honest) for me to be comfortable being judged on them.
                So that's why I've challeneged myself to complete 12 projects over the next 12 months. </p>
                
                <p>This portfolio website is the first project, and it's where I'll document the following eleven. I've chosen this approach as opposed to simply 
                cleaning up my half-finished projects scattered across various USB sticks and hard drives, as it gives me an opportunity 
                to learn new skills and re-fresh old ones, as I am aiming for each of the 12 projects to focus on a different computer 
                science discipline and set of skills. </p>
                
                <p>Enjoy!</p>
