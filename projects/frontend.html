            <h1>Using React.js to Produce a Dashboard UI</h1>
            <h2>March/April 2022</h2>
            <p>During this project, I continued the work on the stock market dashboard that's been the subject of the
                previous few projects. I used the web app from
                <a href="../projects/webapp.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Project V</a>, and implemented the UI I
                designed in
                <a href="../projects/design.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Project IV</a>, using
                <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">React.js</a>.
            </p>
            <p>Unfortunately, due to circumstances beyond my control, I've had to put this project on hold. I have yet
                to complete the entire UI, but I've made good progress that I'm proud of, so I'll showcase here what
                I've done so far. I'll also talk about the remaining features, that I'll hopefully get around to
                completing sometime later this year.</p>
            <h3>Overview Page</h3>
            <p>The overview page is almost complete, the only missing element is the 'enter data' card in the top right.
                I left this until last as it's a little more complicated due to the fact that it needs to pass data
                to the backend and store it properly so it can be access in the future. </p>
            <br>
            <div id="imgDiv">
                <img class="img_single" src="../img/Overview.png">
            </div>
            <p id="imgSub"><em>The initial design for the overview page</em></p>
            <br>
            <div id="imgDiv">
                <img class="img_single" src="../img/overview_real.png">
            </div>
            <p id="imgSub"><em>The current state of the overview page</em></p>
            <br><br>

            <p>A few notes about this page:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I took great care to ensure the page scales to different screen sizes. It isn't compatible with
                    really small screens, e.g. mobile devices, but the cards, text etc. are dynamically sized.</li>
                <li>I'm really happy with the header. It looks almost identical to the original design, and the 'time in
                    the market' counter on the right ticks live from the datetime of the first transaction.</li>
                <li>The time selector works well too, I used a third party component for this, that I'll credit at the
                    bottom of this page.</li>
                <li>The line graph works as intended - the time selector changes the x-axis, and the dropdown allows you
                    to select different moving averages. Switching the toggle in the top right changes the lines to be
                    the different markets e.g. SPY, NASDAQ etc., however the y-axis is fixed to Â£, whereas it should
                    really be % for this view.</li>
                <li>The treemap sections change colour based on the return in the selected time period. They're all
                    green in the screenshot because I purposefully chose well-performing stocks and the view spans 10 years.
                    This is what it looks like in a smaller scale:</li>
                <br>
                <div id="imgDiv">
                    <img class="img_single" src="../img/treemap.png">
                </div>
                <br>
                <li>Also on the treemap, if the box is too thin for the text to fit, the stock ticker is replaced with "..."</li>
                <li>The summary card is a lot simpler than the original design. I realised the line graph background in
                    the design was redundant, as it would just match the line graph on the right of it, so this was an
                    intentional change. However, the card itself is quite boring, and I didn't get around to
                    implementing a gauge for the volatility, which would be a good feature as the raw 'VIX' value isn't
                    particularly helpful to see at first glance. Having said all this, all the necessary components are
                    present</li>
                <li>The pie chart has two parts, the inner chart represents sectors and the outer represents industries
                    within those sectors.</li>
                <li>As the pie chart gets more populated, having a legend (or visible labels as in the design) gets a
                    bit cluttered. Therefore I made the intentional choice to remove all labels, and rely on tooltips to
                    inspect what each section represents.</li>
                <li>Speaking of tooltips, all the graphs on this page have tooltips to give more detailed information.
                    The tooltips follow the mouse as it moves, here's a few examples of what they look like:</li>
                <br>
                <div id="imgDiv">
                    <img id="tooltipImg" src="../img/tooltips.png">
                </div>
                <br><br>
            </ul>
            <h3>Breakdown and Details Page</h3>
            <p>Unfortunately, I only completed the area graph for the breakdown page. It shows the composition of the
                portfolio over time, and you can hover over to see a tooltip providing the individual values. The next
                step is to add the stock summary, and the 'winners and losers' cards.
                I also didn't get around to making the table on the details page.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <div id="imgDiv">
                <img class="img_single" src="../img/Breakdown.PNG">
            </div>
            <p id="imgSub"><em>The initial design for the breakdown page</em></p>
            <br>
            <div id="imgDiv">
                <img class="img_single" src="../img/breakdown_real.png">
            </div>
            <p id="imgSub"><em>The current state of the breakdown page</em></p>
            <br><br>

            <h3>Future Plans</h3>
            <p>As I mentioned earlier, there a few missing features from the application, which will take priority when
                I revisit this project. Part of the reason why these features are missing is because I spent a long time
                making sure each each feature I implemented was to the highest quality, so there's very little I would
                change/improve from the existing features, aside from the volatility gauge in the summary card.</p>
