            <h1>Project III: Data Science - Generating, Manipulating and Analysing Trading Data</h1>
            <h2>November 2021</h2>
            <p>At the time of writing I work as a data analyst, so I found this project much easier to get into quickly.
                The goal was to
                take data I recieved from my stock broker, clean it up, and extract some insights. My intention is that
                the next few projects will follow
                on from each other, so next month I'll design a UI to visualise this data. Then I plan to build a
                Node/React web
                app to host it, and implement the designed UI using D3.js.</p>
            <p>I chose to use <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter Notebooks</a> instead of normal Python files after
                they were recommended to me by a colleague as the segmentation of the code into cells makes it easier to
                build-up complex programs. This worked really well, and there was a speed advantage too, as lengthy
                tasks such as retrieving stock market data only had to be executed once.
            I also made heavy use of <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/index.html">Pandas</a>, as it's a
                library I've been meaning to learn for a while now and it's perfectly suited for a data-heavy project such as this.</p>
            <p>The project has three Python notebook files, each with a distinct function.</p><br>
            <h3>Cleanup.pynb</h3>
            <p>The broker I use is called Freetrade. They provide transactional data in the form of a single CSV with
                the following columns:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Value Date</strong>: Date of transaction</li>
                <li><strong>Type</strong>: Type of transaction e.g. deposit, buy, sell, etc.</li>
                <li><strong>Details</strong>: Text explanation of transaction e.g. '1.5 Tesla Motors Inc (US88160R1014)
                    @ USD 615.10000 (@ 1 USD = 1.38887 GBP) on 04-Mar-2021 20:30:26'
                </li>
                <li><strong>Value</strong>: The amount bought/sold/given in GBP. It's signed i.e. outgoings are negative
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Although it contains all the data I need, most of the uesful data is packed into the string contained in
                the 'details' column. This gave me an opportunity to face another area I have always struggled with -
                regular expressions. They still look like hieroglyphics to me, but at least I now feel confident
                building
                complex regular expressions (as long as I have access to <a href="https://regexr.com/">regexr.com</a>).
            </p>
            <p>Cleanup.ipynb serves to extract all the useful information from this CSV file and
                export it into three files:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>basic.csv</strong>: All buys/sells with the columns Date, Type, Value, ShareCount, FXRate,
                    Name, and Currency. Most analyses only require buys and sells, so it made sense to group them into
                    a dedicated file.
                </li><br>
                <li><strong>dividend.csv</strong>: All dividend payments with the columns Date, Value, and Name. This is
                    similar to <i>other.csv</i> below, but a dividend transaction is tied to a specific company, whereas
                    all
                    other transactions aren't.
                </li><br>
                <li><strong>other.csv</strong>: All other transactions e.g. interest, fx fee, deposits etc. with the
                    columns Date, Value, and Type
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>This file won't be of much use to anyone who isn't trying to clean up transactional data specifically
                from Freetrade, but it was necessary on my part in order to make the next two parts much less painful.
            </p><br>

            <h3>Analyse.pynb</h3>
            <p>The next part wasw to take this cleaned data, and produce some basic insights. I plan to add more useful
                outputs in the future, but that'll come after I've designed the UI and done a bit more research into the
                different ways to analyse portoflio performance. The file reads data in the format exported from
                <i>cleanup.ipynb</i> as described above, and plots a basic value chart (+ rolling average curves) along
                woth some basic calculations and summaries printed to the console. It also outputs more detailed summary
                tables to CSV files
            </p>
            <p>The plots are very basic and don't look too pretty, but these plots only serve as a visual check to see
                if the calculations look right. In the future, I'll be using D3.js to make interactive graphs from this
                data.</p>
            <br>
            <div id="imgDiv">
                <img class="img" src="../img/graph.png">
                <img class="img" src="../img/console_datascience.png">
            </div>
            <p id="imgSub"><em>A graph of daily value + 60 day rolling average (left), and a snippet of the console
                    summary output (right). Both using synthetic data.</em></p>
            <br>

            <h3>Synthesise.pynb</h3>
            <p>There were a few reasons for generating synthetic versions of the required input datasets. For one, I
                wanted to be able to show some outputs here on this page, and in the code on GitHub, but I didn't want
                to use my own
                trading data. Secondly, it's useful to test my systems (both the current <i>analyse.pynb</i> and
                any future system) using a more complex dataset where I could enter extreme values e.g. 50 years+ of
                data, or extremely high deposit amounts. Lastly, generating 'realistic' synthetic data is something I'm
                currently doing at work, so I thought it'd be a useful skill to hone.</p>
            <p>
                The file takes a number of input parameters, and outputs fake data in the format described at the end of
                the <i>cleanup</i> section above. These parameters are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Start and End Date</strong>: The date range to synthesise transactions over.</li>
                <li><strong>Deposit Amount</strong>: The total amount of money to trade with.</li>
                <li><strong>Deposit Number</strong>: The number of individual deposits to spread 'deposit amount' over.
                </li>
                <li><strong>FX Rate</strong>: To simplify things, rather than using the correct fx rate at the time of
                    each transaction, a basic fx rate (USD-GBP) is hard-coded and applied to all transactions.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Buy Number</strong>: The number of 'buy' transactions to simulate.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Man/Max Spend</strong>: The minimum and maximum percentage (between 0-1) of the current cash
                    balance to spend when generating a buy. Higher max = spend more per buy = more sells (see below).
                    Wider range = more 'noisy' buy values.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Max Sell</strong>: The maximum percentage (between 0-1) of the current portfolio to sell at
                    any given sell transaction. Sells are currently used to add cash when a 'buy' is not possible due to
                    lack of funds. Therefore the higher this number, the fewer (but larger) sells there will be.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Tickers</strong>: The companies to buy/sell. I chose two different companies each from the
                    sectors technology, food, energy, finance, health, along with two ETFs.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>From this, deposits are randomly generated on dates spread out throughout the date range, then buys are
                generated. When a buy isn't possible due to a lack of funds, a sell is generated to free up some cash to
                buy with. My original plan was to be a bit more intelligent with this, and allow the user to specify the
                number of sells. However, I ran into an issue - either you generate the buys then the sells or you
                generate the buys and sells at the same time. The issue with the former is that you'll be left with a
                lot of unspent cash at the end, and the latter is more complex to implement than expected. So instead I
                tried
                generating half the buys, then all the sells, then the second half of the buys.
            </p>
            <p>In trying to
                solve this issue, I came to realise that the intention here is to balance randomness and uniformity. We
                want to use randomness to introduce 'noise', as real-world data will inevitably be noisy. However, we
                also want the
                deposits, buys, and sells to be somewhat evenly distributed throughout the date range. My
                half-and-half solution is both too uniform and too complex. I had another idea to assign weights to
                'buy', 'sell' and 'deposit', and to alter the weights after each transaction based on the current
                portoflio e.g. if there was little cash left, increase the chances of generating a deposit by increasing
                it's weight. This solves the issue of uniformity, but was still a bit too complicated for my liking.
            </p>
            <p>I
                ended up settling for the following: randomly generate deposits, then generate buys incrementally based
                on the amount of cash we have, if we don't have enough then generate a sell. I think this is a good
                balance of random/uniform, and it isn't unrealistic for a person to act this way when trading either. It
                also made the implementeation much simpler. However, one downside is that I had to remove the ability to
                specify how many sells to include. I didn't see this as a major issue though, as the purpose of this
                project is
                to track long-term growth portfolio, of which there shouldn't be an emphasis on selling.</p>

            <h3>Future Plans</h3>
            <p>I have a number of improvements in mind, and I spotted some minor issues as I was finalising the code at
                the end of
                this project. I plan to work on them when I revist this code later.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To optimse the retrieval of data, I only get historical data from the date of the first buy to the
                    date of the last sell (if it's not currently being held). However, to optimise this further and add
                    some future-proofing, I should save the historcial data locally so I don't need to request the full
                    amount
                    every run.</li>
                <li>I read online that you shouldn't build-up a pandas dataframe incrementally e.g. using a loop.
                    Instead, you should
                    generate the data in regular Python lists and convert it to a dataframe at the end. I stuck with
                    this, but it has resulted in some cumbersome lines of code with many 'append' statements. This is
                    probably due to the fact that I built-up my dataframes using a separate list for each column of
                    data. This works for dataframes with a couple of columns, but is probably too long-winded for larger
                    dataframes so could be streamlined.</li>
                <li>Another thing I read online was that you should never (unless absolutely necessary) loop through a
                    dataframe row-by-row. I did this once, in the very early stages of this project, and only spotted it
                    right at the end.</li>
                <li>I noticed myself writing very similar code to find the most recent valid value multiple times. For
                    example, if I was trying to get the price of a certain stock on a given day but there wasn't data
                    for that day, try the previous day and repeat until we get a value. I
                    always try and follow the 'DRY' (don't repeat yourself) principle, so I plan to abstract this
                    process into a function in future.</li>
                <li>In the early phases, I used company name rather than ticker symbol. This has led to some dataframe
                    columns being called 'Name' and others named 'Ticker' even though they now all feature ticker
                    symbols. Naming should be consistent, so I'll fix this later.</li>
                <li>There was an issue with a couple of companies I've traded (PFE and INRG.L) that caused me to add a
                    lazy, hard-coded fix in <i>cleanup.pynb</i>.</li>
            </ul>
