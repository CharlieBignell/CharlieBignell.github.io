            <h1>Project I: Web Development</h1>
            <h2>September 2021</h2>
            <p>In 2014, I decided I wanted to study computer science at University. Given that my school didn't offer it
                as an A-Level, I was worried I'd be behind everyone, so I taught myself HTML, CSS and JavaScript using
                online tutorials. Since then, I've used HTML and CSS throughout the last 7 years on various personal
                projects,
                university modules and on my placement year. So putting together
                a simple website like this wasn't much of a learning curve.</p>
            <p>There were two elements that were new to me, though:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Hosting</strong><br>Even though I've made plenty of web pages over the last few years, I've
                    never
                    owned a domain or put too much thought into the back-end infrastructure that goes into web
                    development. After a bit of research, I bought the domain <em>charliebignell.uk</em> and paid for
                    hosting via <a href="https://www.pilchard.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pilchard.co.uk</a>. I then
                    developed the webiste
                    using <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub Pages</a>. I've used Pages a couple
                    of times and
                    it's a really cheap and easy way to get a website up and running quickly, and I was already
                    uploading the code to GitHub so it seemed like the best choice. I then had
                    to tell GitHub Pages to use my cutom domain and add a CNAME record in my DNS settings to redirect my
                    purchased URL, which was more complicated than expected, but I got
                    there in the end.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Developing for mobile</strong><br>I've seen the phrase '<a
                        href="https://medium.com/@Vincentxia77/what-is-mobile-first-design-why-its-important-how-to-make-it-7d3cf2e29d00"
                        target="_blank" rel="noopener">mobile
                        first</a>' a lot of times over
                    the last few years, but I've never worked on a project with a large enough scope to adhere to it.
                    This is the biggest lesson I learnt during this project. I naively assumed that because the site is
                    very basic, and I've used <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/"
                        target="_blank" rel="noopener">flexbox</a> throughout which is
                    very responsive to screen dimensions,
                    it should adapt to mobile devices without me needing to do anything. I was wrong. <br>As the site is
                    so simple, it wasn't too difficult to adapt it for smaller screen sizes, but it took a lot longer
                    than I expected. The main issue was the navigation bar, which simply doesn't work on a smaller
                    screen. I went with a hamburger menu in the end, but this required javascript and a lot more CSS
                    than I expected. In the end though, I'm very happy with the final product, and I'll never forget
                    'mobile first' again.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Once I'd set up the URL it was as simple as creating a basic html structure, adding some fancy CSS,
                and writing
                the content. The writing was definitely the most difficult part.</p>

            <h3>Future Plans</h3>
            <p>The only thing I didn't complete was the 'About Me' Page. I'm planning to make this an online CV, but
                instead of a wall of text I want to give it an intersting layout with colour and images. I don't have
                time to do this now, but
                it's only really needed when I start applying to jobs, so I'll complete it later.</p>
