            <h1>Tagger - A Java 'Cheatsheet'</h1>
            <h2>October 2021</h2>
            <p>Tagger is a music library organisation system built on the concept of 'tagging' songs, which allows
                the user to create
                and edit playlists easily by specifying tags to include. It's an idea I had recently, after getting
                bored of my Spotify playlists. I wanted to be able to bulk add/remove songs that may seem unrelated
                (e.g. different artists or genres), but they're related in my mind (e.g. songs I want to listen to at
                the gym). I thought if I could spend time tagging each song in my library, I could add and remove tags
                to create/edit playlists quickly and easily, without needing to go through them all individually. I
                don't see this as some kind of revolutionary new idea, but it seemed like a decent enough concept to try
                out in this project.
            </p>

            <h3>Why?</h3>
            <p>The purpose of this project was for me to re-fresh my memory of Java, as it used to be the progamming
                language I was most comfortable with but I hadn't used it for a couple of years before this. So to get
                me back up to speed, I decided to write a little program and try to cram-in as many different
                programming concepts as possible. In doing this, a few redundencies appeared, and certain aspects aren't
                implemented with efficiency in mind. I'll talk more about that in 'Future Plans'.</p>

            <h3>How?</h3>
            <p> I also used this as an opportunity to learn how <a href="https://maven.apache.org/">Maven</a> works.
                Maven is a build automation tool that simplifies the process of writing programs, primarily Java
                programs. Up until this project, I had only written Java programs using <a
                    href="https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">Eclipse</a>, which is an IDE made especially for Java/C
                projects. It's a really useful tool, but to avoid being forever tied to Eclipse, I decided to use Maven
                with my standard code editor (<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSCode</a>) for this project.</p>

            <h3>What?</h3>
            <p>I only implemented the very basics here, but I had many ideas on how to build on this to create a
                powerful system capable of generating large playlists on-the-fly based on complex user-input. I'll go
                into more detail on this in 'Future Plans', but for now I just implemented a basic system
                capable of adding and removing songs/albums with the ability to 'tag' songs with anything the user
                likes. The user can then specify one or more 'tags' to play.</p>
            <p> Ultimately, I was using the tagging idea as a vessel to <strong>try out lots of different concepts in
                    Java, and not
                    necessarily implement a perfect system</strong>. Here are a few
                different concepts that I integrated:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Abstraction and Inheritance</strong><br> One of the first things I learnt at University was
                    the concept of
                    the 'Four Pillars of Object Oriented Programming', and I wanted to ensure they were utilised here.
                    For
                    inheritance, I made an 'Audio' superclass that the 'Song' class inherits from. I didn't go further
                    to create other forms of audio, but the structure could be used to create other types such as
                    podcasts and audiobooks. For abstraction, I made an interface called 'Tracklist', that both 'Album'
                    and 'Playlist' implement. The inheritance of Audio is useful for creating other forms, however the
                    abstraction of Tracklist probably isn't necessary.
                </li><br>
                <li><strong>Generics</strong><br>One benefit of unnecessarily abstracting 'Tracklist', was that it
                    forced
                    me to confront a concept that I never got to grips with at University - generics. In revisting this
                    concept, it
                    wasn't as complicated as I remember and was quite simple to implement. A
                    Tracklist is built with either a list of Songs (for albums), or a list of tags (for playlists).
                </li><br>
                <li><strong>JUnit testing</strong><br>
                    I included some JUnit tests for the basic class methods, but overall my testing on this project was
                    far from extensive. Basic tests for tasks like getters and setters are included to refresh my memory
                    on how JUnit test are completed, but I didn't spend too much time writing more complex tests for
                    things like ensuring the correct exceptions being thrown in certain scenarios.
                </li><br>
                <li><strong>File IO</strong><br>
                    In my original design, a Playlist would only keep track of a list of tags, and so in order to 'play'
                    the right songs I had a CSV file to keep track of the songs and their tags. This ended up being more
                    complicated than necessary, so I added in a 'Library' class to hold the songs. But the use of the
                    CSV input remained as a way of initialising a Library with a set of songs when it's first created.
                </li><br>
                <li><strong>Singleton</strong><br>
                    After adding in the Library class, I thought it'd be a good opportunity to implement a singleton
                    pattern, as there should never be a need to initialise multiple Library instances.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>I also included examples of polymorphism, encapsulation, exception handling (checked and unchecked),
                method overloading and overriding, console IO, and probably others I've forgotten to mention.</p>

            <br>

            <h3>Future Plans</h3>
            <p>As I mentioned earlier, there are some redundencies and minor issues with the completed codebase. Here are some of them:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>There are a few very similar methods in the Library class that could possibly be merged with the use
                    of generics.</li>
                <li>Initialising albums is a bit cumbersome, as the user needs to add each song individually first, then
                    specify which songs belong to the album.</li>
                <li>In creating the Library class, it became much easier to play songs with a given tag through this
                    class rather than the Playlist class, rendering Playlist redundant.</li>
                <li>Inputs are not sanitised. There aren't any databases involved here so this isn't too much of an issue, but some basic formatting for things like capitalisation could be added.</li>
                <li>The testing is not extensive enough, and I only realised late in the project that I was using JUnit4
                    and not JUnit5.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I'd like to fix these issues in the future if I get time.</p>
            <p>There are also more features I'd like to have implemented, these include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Allow the user to add and play actual music files.</li>
                <li>More complex playlist creation involving basic logic e.g. tag1 AND tag2 NOT tag3.</li>
                <li>Add the ability to shuffle a playlist or define a specific order.</li>
                <li>Add a time-dimension to the data e.g. date song added, date tag added to song/playlist.</li>
                <li>Add more forms of audio e.g. podcast, audiobook.</li>
                <li>Include pre-defined genres using an enumeration.</li>
                <li>Implement a GUI to replace the console menu.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I'm not sure if I'll spend time including these extra features, but perhaps I will if I revist the
                project to fix the issues mentioned earlier. Overall, this project was a success in that it refreshed my
                memory of Java, along with some key language-agnostic concepts and design patterns.</p>
