            <h1>Tagger - A Java 'Cheatsheet'</h1>
            <h2>October 2021</h2>
            <p>Tagger is a organisation system is built on the concept of 'tagging' songs, and allows the user to create
                and edit playlists easily by specifying tags to include. It's an idea I had recently, after getting
                bored of my Spotify playlists. I thought it'd be easier if I could somehow bulk add/remove certain
                songs, rather than go through them one-by-one.

            </p>
            <p>I only implemented the very basics here, but I had many ideas on how to build on this to create a
                powerful system capable of generating large playlists on-the-fly based on complex user-input. I'll go
                into more detail on this in the 'Future Plans' section, but for now I just implemented a basic system
                capable of adding and removing songs/albums with the ability to 'tag' songs with anything the user
                likes. They can then specify one or more 'tags' to play.</p>

            <p>The purpose of this project was for me to re-fresh my memory of Java, as it used to be the progamming
                language I was most comfortable with but I hadn't used it for a couple of years before this. So to get
                me back up to speed, I decided to write a little program and try to cram-in as many different
                programming concepts as possible. In doing this, a few redundencies appeared, and certain aspects aren't
                implemented with efficiency in mind. Ultimately, I was using the tagging idea as a vessel to try out
                lots of concepts in Java, and not necessarily implement a perfect system.Below are just a few of them:
            </p>
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Abstraction</strong><br></li>
                <li><strong>Inheritance</strong><br></li>
                <li><strong>Singleton</strong><br></li>
                <li><strong>Generics</strong><br></li>
                <li><strong>Exceptions</strong><br></li>
                <li><strong>Junit testing</strong><br></li>
                <li><strong>File IO</strong><br></li>
            </ul>

            <p>I also included evidence of polymorphism, encapsulation, method overloading, overriding, console IO, </p>
