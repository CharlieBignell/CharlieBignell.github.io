            <h1>Tagger - A Java 'Cheatsheet'</h1>
            <h2>October 2021</h2>
            <p>Tagger is a music library organisation system is built on the concept of 'tagging' songs, which allows
                the user to create
                and edit playlists easily by specifying tags to include. It's an idea I had recently, after getting
                bored of my Spotify playlists. I wanted a method of bulk adding/removing songs that may seem unrelated
                (e.g. different artists or genres), but they're related in my mind (e.g. songs I want to listen to at
                the gym). I thought if I could spend time tagging each song in my library, I could add and remove tags
                to create/edit playlists quickly and easily, without needing to go through them all individually. I
                don't see this as some kind of revelotionary new idea, but it seemed like a decent enough concept to try
                out in this project.
            </p>

            <h3>Why?</h3>
            <p>The purpose of this project was for me to re-fresh my memory of Java, as it used to be the progamming
                language I was most comfortable with but I hadn't used it for a couple of years before this. So to get
                me back up to speed, I decided to write a little program and try to cram-in as many different
                programming concepts as possible. In doing this, a few redundencies appeared, and certain aspects aren't
                implemented with efficiency in mind. I'll talk more about that in 'Future Plans'.</p>

            <h3>How?</h3>
            <p> I also used this as an opportunity to learn how <a href="https://maven.apache.org/">Maven</a> works.
                Maven is a build automation tool that simplifies the process of writing programs, primarily Java
                programs. Up until this project, I had only written Java programs using <a
                    href="https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">Eclipse</a>, which is an IDE made especially for Java/C
                projects. It's a really useful tool, but to avoid being forever tied to Eclipse, I decided to use Maven
                with my standard code editor (<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSCode</a>) for this project.</p>

            <h3>What?</h3>
            <p>I only implemented the very basics here, but I had many ideas on how to build on this to create a
                powerful system capable of generating large playlists on-the-fly based on complex user-input. I'll go
                into more detail on this in 'Future Plans', but for now I just implemented a basic system
                capable of adding and removing songs/albums with the ability to 'tag' songs with anything the user
                likes. The user can then specify one or more 'tags' to play.</p>
            <p> Ultimately, I was using the tagging idea as a vessel to <strong>try out lots of different concepts in
                    Java, and not
                    necessarily implement a perfect system</strong>. Here are a few
                different concepts I integrated:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Abstraction and Inheritance</strong><br> One of the first things I learnt at University was
                    the concept of
                    the 'Four Pillars of Object Oriented Programming', and I wanted to ensure they were utilised here.
                    For
                    inheritance, I made an 'Audio' superclass that the 'Song' class inherits from. I didn't go further
                    to create other forms of audio, but the structure could be used to create other types such as
                    podcasts and audiobooks. For abstraction, I made an interface called 'Tracklist', that both 'Album'
                    and 'Playlist' implement. The inheritance of Audio is useful for creating outher forms, however the
                    abstraction of Tracklist probably isn't necessary. In regards to the remaing two 'pillars',
                    encapsulation comes naturally with Java, and so does polymorphism if inheritance is involved.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Generics</strong><br>One benefit of unnecessarily abstracting 'Tracklist', was that it forced
                    me to confront a concept I never got to grips with at University - generics. In revisting this concept, it
                    wasn't as complicated as I remember and was quite simple to implement. A
                    Tracklist is built with either a list of Songs (for albums), or a list of tags (for playlists).
                </li>
                <li><strong>Junit testing</strong><br></li>
                <li><strong>File IO</strong><br></li>
                <li><strong>Singleton</strong><br></li>
            </ul>

            <p>I also included evidence of polymorphism, encapsulation, exception handling (checked and unchecked), method overloading and overriding, console IO, and probably others I've forgotten to mention.</p>
