            <h1>Designing a Dashboard User Interface</h1>
            <h2>December 2021</h2>

            <p>Following on from the previous project of data science using trading data, I've designed a stock market
                dashboard user interface.
                My aim is to spend the next couple of months building a web app using this design, and deploying a web
                server to host it.
            </p>
            <p>
                I used <a href="https://procreate.art/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Procreate</a> on an iPad to create the initial sketches, and <a
                    href="https://www.figma.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Figma</a> to turn these into the dashboard concepts.
            </p>
            <p>I've used Procreate casually over the last year, and the sketches were very basic, so this was nothing
                new to me. I'd heard of Figma, but never used it before this project. Although it's packed full of
                features, I found
                it very easy to get started with, so I can see myself using it more in the future. </p>
            <p>I spent time
                collecting two types of resource before starting the design process:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A list of ways to evaluate the performance of a stock portfolio e.g. return over time,
                    diversification, volatility</li>
                <li>Examples of how to display this data. This came in the form of example graphs I found online, as
                    well as other dashboard interfaces I may want to use as inspiration</li>
            </ul>

            <p>I'm no artist, so I spent a lot of time on the latter. I found example pie charts, line graphs etc., as
                well as basic UI elements such as navigation bars and input forms. Once I had organised all this
                reference material, I started sketching out the initial designs, which you can see in the following
                sections. I made minor changes to the design as I started implementing the sketches in Figma, but I
                altered the original sketches to reflect these changes.</p>
            <p>One rule I set for myself was that I wanted every visual to have a real utility i.e. I didn't want to
                just add graphs that would look good but have no real use.</p>
            <p>I settled on three pages which increase in granularity, from a high-level overview to a detailed table summary.</p>

            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>This page provides the highest-level overview of the users portfolio.</p>

            <p>
                Given that the only intended end-user is myself, I made every design decision (e.g. dark mode colour
                scheme) based on my own preference. I went with the typical dashboard structure of a navigation bar at
                the top, and 'cards' of various dimensions making up the page. I made sure that it would all fit on a
                single page to avoid the need for any scrolling. This also helps limit the scope, as It limits the
                number of visualisations. Speaking of which, there a quite a few on this first page:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Time selector: </strong>This changes the time frame for the line graph, summary, and tree
                    map
                    colours. I originally designed this selector only for the line graph, but I ended
                    up adding it to other cards, so it made more sense to abstract it out. </li>
                <li><strong>Line graph: </strong>A basic line graph to show value, deposits and return over
                    time. There's a dropdown to allow the user to select different moving averages, and a toggle which
                    would change the graph to compare my performance with the wider market.</li>
                <li><strong>Summary: </strong>A simple card to summarise the portfolio over the selected time period.
                    The background is the line graph of return during this period.</li>
                <li><strong>Market Comparison: </strong>A simple bar graph comparing my return to other markets over the
                    selected time period.</li>
                <li><strong>Tree map: </strong>The size of each section represents the portion of my current portfolio
                    value for each stock. So this won't change as the time selector is used, but the colour (green ->
                    red colour scale) represents the return over the selected time period. </li>
                <li><strong>Enter Data: </strong>I originally planned to have an 'Enter Data' button in the header that
                    would open a new window to enter transactions, but I found some space to put it as a card. This
                    simplifies the implementation too, as it keeps everything on a single page.</li>
                <li><strong>Sector value: </strong>This pie chart shows the value of my portfolio taken up by each
                    sector. Similar to the tree map section sizes, this won't change as the time selector changes. I
                    didn't leave enough room for a legend, so this card might look different in the implementation.</li>
                

            </ul>

            <p>I had a rule whilst I was designing this page that there shouldn't be any mention of an individual
                company anywhere on the page. I put this rule in place to ensure that it remained as high-level as
                possible. Technically I broke this rule with the tree-map, but I'd justify it
                by the fact that you need all the companies together for the graph to have any utility so it's still a
                very high-level visualisation. </p>

            </div>
            <p id="imgSub"><em>The initial sketch for the overview page</em></p>
            <br>
            <div id="imgDiv">

<br><br>
            <h3>Breakdown</h3>
            <p>This is a slightly lower-level view of the data. The aim of this page is to give a similar summary as the previous page, but broken-down by individual company. There are four cards on this page:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Time selector:</strong> This works in the same way as the previous page</li>
                <li><strong>Summary:</strong> A similar summary card as the previous page, but with a bit more detail on each individual company.
                    It should
                    work a bit like a slideshow, where the user can flick through each company.</li>
                <li><strong>Winners & Losers: </strong>A simple card showing the 'best' and 'worst' performing company
                    in three
                    categories - return, volatility, and RSI. This is just a concept, I might end up using different
                    metrics in the implementation.</li>
                <li><strong>Area chart:</strong> This chart breaks down the portfolio by company. You can't see the
                    overall
                    value over time (like you can on the overview page), but instead you can see which companies make-up
                    the portfolio over time. I think this'll be a really interesting graph to look at with my real
                    portfolio data, but I'm not sure what utility it has, so it may be altered in the
                    implementation. </li>
            </ul>

                <img class="img_single" src="../img/Breakdown_wire.PNG">

            <p id="imgSub"><em>The initial sketch for the breakdown page</em></p>

            <p id="imgSub"><em>The final design for the breakdown page</em></p>
            <br><br>

            <h3>Details</h3>
            <p>This page is just a single table, broken-down by company. There are some example columns below, but my
                plan is to have a menu button (top right of the table), that when clicked shows a checklist where the
                user can select which columns to include. I don't want to limit myself by predefining the columns, but
                if I include all of them at once there'll be a lot of side-scrolling necessary which I wanted to avoid.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <div id="imgDiv">
                <img class="img_single" src="../img/Details_wire.PNG">
            </div>
            <p id="imgSub"><em>The initial sketch for the details page</em></p>
            <br>
            <div id="imgDiv">
                <img class="img_single" src="../img/Details.png">
            </div>
            <p id="imgSub"><em>The final design for the details page</em></p>

            <h3>Future Plans</h3>
            <p>The next step is to set up the web app and implement these designs. There are some more pages I have in
                mind, but I thought it'd be best to stick to just these three simple ones first, and then I can design
                and implement more pages in the future if this goes well. The extra pages include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>An even lower-level page, with a table of individual transactions.</strong> This would work
                    in the same way
                    as the 'Details' page, so it doesn't really need designing. I'm not sure if such a table is
                    necessary so I haven't included it here, but I'd probably just add a toggle to the 'Details' page to
                    switch between company/transaction view.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>A stock screener.</strong>The issue with this is that it would require a live connection to
                    a data source. My plan is for the back-end data to refresh once a day, and so there's no need
                    to implement any live connections to the Yahoo finance API. Adding a stock screener would complicate
                    this, so I've left it out for now. Also, there are some advanced stock screeners out there, so I
                    wouldn't want to produce anything where there's an alternative I'd rather use.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>An 'Action' page.</strong>This was a page in my original designs, that I took out. It was a
                    page dedicated to informing me of where to take action i.e. where to buy more of, or sell, stocks
                    that are currently in my portfolio. There would be an RSS feed for relevant news, dates such as
                    upcoming earnings, and more detailed analysis on past performance. I decided against this page as I
                    didn't feel comfortable enough with my stock market knowledge to populate it with useful metrics.
                    I'd be simply guessing at what will be useful, and as I plan to spend more time honing my trading
                    strategy over the next year, I thought it'd be best to leave it until I have a more tried-and-tested
                    method for evaluating my own portfolio.
