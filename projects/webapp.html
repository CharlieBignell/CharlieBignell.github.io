            <h1>Setting up a Basic Web Application and Preparing the Data</h1>
            <h2>January 2021</h2>
            <p>In the previous couple of months, I have spent time analysing
                stock market trading data, and designing a user interface to visualise this analysis. In February, I
                will use this data anlysis to
                implement the designed user interface to produce a fully-functioning portoflio tracker. Before I do this
                though, I need a basic, full-stack application to handle the back-end data retrieval and the front-end
                page
                serving.</p>
            <p>During my placement year at university, most of my time was spent producing a similar dashboard
                application. I used <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Node</a> for the back-end, and
                basic HTML/CSS for the front end. A
                little ways into the project, I pivoted to <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">React</a> as a front-end
                framework, which made it a lot easier to build a complex dashboard due to its modular nature. Given that
                I had experience with Node-React, I knew it would be a good fit so I chose to follow a similar path.</p>
            <p>I spent the first week of this month creating a basic project structure. This was aided by the really
                useful package <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app" target="_blank" rel="noopener">create-react-app</a>, which can quickly set up the structure of a React server. Then I used <a href="https://expressjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Express.js</a>, an
                easy-to-use Node.js framework that can handle the
                back-end.</p>
            <p>For the remaining few weeks of January, I spent some time getting the data in the exact form I needed,
                ready to start making the visulaisations in February. I had done some analyses in November, which was a
                good starting point, but now that I have designed the front-end, I was able to come up with a proper
                data specification. In the end, I decided the most simple yet comprehensive structure would be to
                have three files:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>stocks.csv: </b>This holds information on individual stocks e.g. Name, sector, total value of my
                    portfolio, etc.</li>
                <li><b>daily.csv: </b>This is a daily (one row = one day) dataset with items such as value, return,
                    buys, sells, etc.</li>
                <li><b>daily_stocks.csv: </b>Combining the first two, this is a daily-level dataset for each stock i.e. each
                    row is a stock-day, with items such as closing price, buys, sells, etc. </li>
            </ul>

            <p>I spent a couple of weeks working out exactly which fields I needed (using the UI designs), and then
                tweaking my earlier python code to produce these three files as CSVs. I then made sure the Express
                back-end
                could serve a given dataset based on an API call from the front-end.
                </p>
                <p> I'm now ready to start the
                front-end
                development and build some of these data visualisations.</p>

                    here</a></p><br>
            <h3>Future Plans</h3>

            <p>My initital plan was to put the cleaned and processed trading data (in CSV form) into a <a
                    href="https://www.mysql.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MySQL</a> database, and perform any necessary <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CRUD</a> operations on this database from the
                Express.js back-end. I dabbled with this for a while, but had some technical issues. I ran out of time
                this month to fully migrate from CSV files to the MySQL database, but I plan to add this in the future.
                For now, CSV files will work fine, even if it isn't the most optimised and robust way to go about
                this.</p>
            <p>Also, despite spending time to make sure I was producing accurate outputs, I'm aware that I haven't written any
                formal tests to proeprly validate the data outputs. In order to do this
                properly, I've decided to dedicate a full month to testing, error handling, bug fixing etc. once I've
                built the front-end of this application.</p>
