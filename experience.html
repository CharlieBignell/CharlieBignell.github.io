            <h1>Work Experience</h1>
            <p>Since graduating from the University of Surrey with a First Class BSc (Hons) degree in computer science,
                I have worked as an analyst for Imperial College London, in the Neonatal Medicine Research Group. During
                this role I have honed my data analysis skills - including Python, R and SQL. During my degree, I
                completed a placement year at STFC, where I built and maintained multiple pieces of software. These two
                key work experiences have shaped me into a versatile software developer.</p>
            <hr>

            <h3>Imperial College London - Health Intelligence Analyst</h3>
            <p><i>September 2020 - present</i></p>
            <p>Since September 2020, I have worked as part of an MRC-funded project to produce public-facing data
                visualisation tools using neonatal data.
                The overarching aim of this project is to increase the utility of the National Neonatal Research
                Database (NNRD), which contains patient data for infants admitted to a neonatal ward - comprising nearly
                1.5
                million entries, with over 450 variables per entry.
            </p>
            <p>
                Working with this large amount of data has been an extremely rewarding yet challenging task. I have
                greatly improved upon my programming and data analysis skills, including Python, R, and SQL. I have also
                spent a lot of time gathering requirements and feedback from a wide range of people. This includes
                parents of premature children, data managers, clinicians and researchers. I have also worked with
                personnel from 15 different countries, to produce a similar suite of tools using worldwide neonatal
                data.
                This experience has helped me to grow in confidence, improving my communication and presentation skills.
                It has also been an interesting challenge to work with people from so many different backgrounds - in
                terms of both professional discipline and culture.
            </p>
            <p>Some of the tools I have produced have been published for public use. <a
                    href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/neonatal-data-analysis-unit/neonatal-data-analysis-unit/Neonatal-Data-Visualisations/"
                    target="_blank" rel="noopener">You can view them here.</a></p>
            <p>As I near the end of my contract in this role, I have also been working on a new research publication
                that I'm
                extremely proud of. I have been investigating the growth pattern of preterm infants, and comparing these
                results
                to the existing growth charts used in neonatal practice today.</p>

            <p>Overall, this has been a rewarding role where I have learnt a lot of new skills. I feel I have
                transitioned from fresh graduate to fully-fledged computer scientist, and I'm excited to take on my next
                challenge.</p>

            <h3>Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) - Software Developer</h3>
            <p><i>June 2018 - June 2019</i></p>
            <p>Part of my four-year degree included a year-long placement in industry. I spent my time at STFC, where I
                worked as part of a three-person team called Performance Improvement, working on the <a
                    href="https://www.isis.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/home.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ISIS Neutron and
                    Muon Source</a>. Our role was to find areas
                within the organisation that could be streamlined with a bespoke project. My
                time was spent updating and maintaining various tools that were used across the site.
            </p>
            <p>
                The majority of
                my time was spent independently working on a web application that provided statistical analyses of alarm
                data. These ~2000 alarms are connected to sensors across the particle accelerator, but engineers had to
                use very old software to search through these alarms and find the issue. The web application I built
                helped to streamline this process, and since I left it has been deployed across the site for use by
                hundreds of scientists and engineers.
            </p>
            <p>I regularly discussed details of my projects with both technical and non-technical personnel, and spent
                time gathering requirements and use-cases from them. I believe this experience of 'traditional' software
                development has been complemented by my more data-focussed role at Imperial College London to broaden my
                skill set.</p>

            <h3>University of Surrey - Teaching Assistant</h3>
            <p><i>October 2017 - January 2018</i></p>
            <p>As a part of the peer-assisted learning support (PALS) scheme at the University of Surrey, I helped
                first-year students with their lab sessions. Excellent verbal communication skills were essential. The
                role often involved explaining complex subject matter in simple terms and therefore a deep understanding
                of the material was also required.</p>
